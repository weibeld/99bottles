# 99 Bottles of Beer

My initial solution to the *99 Bottles of Beer* problem in the ["99 Bottles of OOP"](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/) book (before reading the book).

The state of the solution at the end of each chapter is in the branches `chapter-1` to `chapter-6` (from the original repository).

My own solutions at the end of each chapter, as I worked along with the book, are in the branches `my-chap-*`.

There's a number of tags from the original repository pointing to intermediate states of the solution within the different chapters. The naming scheme of these tags is as follows:

- Chapter 2: `tdd-*`
- Chapter 3+4: `unearth-*`
- Chapter 5: `extract-*`
- Chapter 6: `dataclump-*`, `hierarchy-*`, `succ-*`, `sixpack-*`

This is a modified fork of the [original repository](https://github.com/sandimetz/99bottles).
